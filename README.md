# Vaccine-Project
Vaccine-Project-Main is a dynamic web application built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It allows users to view and manage vaccine information, schedules, and health records through a responsive and interactive interface. This project demonstrates my skills in backend development, database integration, and front-end design.
